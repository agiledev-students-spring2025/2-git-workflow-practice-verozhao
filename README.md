## My Comments
The article underscores the rise of distributed IT infrastructure—edge computing and cloud systems—processing data closer to users. By 2024, 90% of new workflows will run on edge networks, with the edge data center market tripling to $13.5B, fueled by IoT, 5G, and remote work demands. Distributed cloud adoption optimizes data handling and compliance with regulations.

## Isaac's Comments
What I found most interesting about this article was the trend of increasing cyberattacks. It feels like as we become more and more knowledgeable it should become easier to defend against these things, but it seems that either cyberattackers have outpaced cybersecurity analysts, or everyone involved is so lazy that even if strategies are known to prevent attacks, they are simply not implemented. Either way, a very interesting read.
